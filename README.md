# HR Data Analysis Project: Understanding Attrition, Equity, and Talent Acquisition 📊

## Overview 🔍

This project analyzes a dataset of employee information to understand key HR metrics, including employee attrition 📉, pay equity ⚖️, recruitment effectiveness 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, and tenure patterns ⏳. The analysis was performed using Tableau Public to create interactive dashboards and visualizations, providing insights that can help inform HR strategies and decision-making.

## Key Questions Addressed 🤔

This analysis aimed to answer the following key questions:

1.  **What are the key drivers of employee attrition, and what proactive measures can the company take to improve retention?**
2.  **Is there a relationship between employee engagement 😊 and performance ⭐, and how can the company leverage this to boost overall productivity?**
3.  **Are there any potential pay equity issues within the organization based on gender 🚺/🚹 or race 🌍, and what steps should be taken to ensure fair compensation practices?**
4.  **Which recruitment sources yield the highest quality hires (e.g., in terms of performance and retention) and what adjustments can be made to the recruitment strategy to optimize cost-effectiveness 💰?**
5.  **How does employee tenure vary across different departments and job roles, and are there any patterns that suggest potential issues with career progression or employee satisfaction in specific areas?**

## Dashboards and Key Findings 💡

The analysis is presented in two Tableau Public dashboards:

**Dashboard 1: Employee Attrition Analysis 📉**

* Provides a comprehensive view of employee turnover.
* Includes visualizations on attrition rate by department, engagement vs. attrition 😊, termination reasons, attrition by tenure ⏳, and performance vs. attrition ⭐.
* Key findings highlight departments with high attrition, the negative correlation between low engagement and turnover, key reasons for termination, attrition trends over tenure, and the relationship between performance and attrition.
* Interactive filters ⚙️ allow for deeper exploration by department and performance score.

**Dashboard 2: HR Insights: Equity ⚖️ and Talent Acquisition 🧑‍🤝‍🧑**

* Focuses on pay equity and the effectiveness of talent acquisition strategies.
* Includes visualizations on average salary by sex 🚺/🚹 and race 🌍, retention rate by recruitment source 💰, average tenure by department and role ⏳, and the relationship between engagement 😊 and performance ⭐.
* Key findings reveal potential pay disparities, the most effective recruitment channels for long-term hires, tenure patterns across roles and departments, and the relationship between employee engagement and performance levels.

## Key Findings 💡

The analysis revealed several key insights:

* **Attrition Drivers:** Certain departments (e.g., Production) showed higher attrition. Lower engagement correlated with termination, and lack of advancement was a key termination reason.
* **Engagement & Performance:** A positive correlation was observed between engagement and performance.
* **Pay Equity:** Potential pay disparities were identified based on gender and race.
* **Recruitment Effectiveness:** Employee referrals and the company website showed the highest retention rates.
* **Tenure Variation:** Average tenure varied significantly by department and role, suggesting potential areas for review.
