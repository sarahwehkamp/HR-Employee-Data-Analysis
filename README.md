# HR Data Analysis Project: Understanding Attrition, Equity, and Talent Acquisition 📊

## Overview 🔍

This project analyzes a dataset of employee information to understand key HR metrics, including employee attrition 📉, pay equity ⚖️, recruitment effectiveness 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, and tenure patterns ⏳. The analysis was performed using Tableau Public to create interactive dashboards and visualizations, providing insights that can help inform HR strategies and decision-making.

## Key Questions Addressed 🤔

This analysis aimed to answer the following key questions:

1.  **What are the key drivers of employee attrition, and what proactive measures can the company take to improve retention?**
2.  **Is there a relationship between employee engagement 😊 and performance ⭐, and how can the company leverage this to boost overall productivity?**
3.  **Are there any potential pay equity issues within the organization based on gender 🚺/🚹 or race 🌍, and what steps should be taken to ensure fair compensation practices?**
4.  **Which recruitment sources yield the highest quality hires (e.g., in terms of performance and retention) and what adjustments can be made to the recruitment strategy to optimize cost-effectiveness 💰?**
5.  **How does employee tenure vary across different departments and job roles, and are there any patterns that suggest potential issues with career progression or employee satisfaction in specific areas?**

## Dashboards and Key Findings 💡

The analysis is presented in two Tableau Public dashboards:

**Dashboard 1: Employee Attrition Analysis 📉**

* Provides a comprehensive view of employee turnover.
* Includes visualizations on attrition rate by department, engagement vs. attrition 😊, termination reasons, attrition by tenure ⏳, and performance vs. attrition ⭐.
* Key findings highlight departments with high attrition, the negative correlation between low engagement and turnover, key reasons for termination, attrition trends over tenure, and the relationship between performance and attrition.
* Interactive filters ⚙️ allow for deeper exploration by department and performance score.

**Dashboard 2: HR Insights: Equity ⚖️ and Talent Acquisition 🧑‍🤝‍🧑**

* Focuses on pay equity and the effectiveness of talent acquisition strategies.
* Includes visualizations on average salary by sex 🚺/🚹 and race 🌍, retention rate by recruitment source 💰, average tenure by department and role ⏳, and the relationship between engagement 😊 and performance ⭐.
* Key findings reveal potential pay disparities, the most effective recruitment channels for long-term hires, tenure patterns across roles and departments, and the relationship between employee engagement and performance levels.

## Key Findings 💡

This analysis of the HR dataset reveals several key insights into employee attrition, engagement, pay equity, recruitment effectiveness, and tenure. The detailed explanations for each finding can be found under the file "[ANSWERS.md](ANSWERS.md)" in this repository.

* **Attrition Drivers:** The Production department shows the highest attrition rate (39.71%). Early-mid career employees (1-4 years tenure) are also at higher risk. Low engagement is strongly correlated with termination. Within Admin Offices, "Career Change" and "No-Call, No-Show" are the top reasons for leaving (11.11% each). Higher termination rates are observed for lower performers, but a notable percentage of "Fully Meets" (32.92%) and "Exceeds" (21.62%) employees also attrited.
* **Engagement & Performance:** Lower engagement scores are associated with terminated employees. Leveraging high engagement through recognition and targeted interventions for lower performers are recommended to potentially boost overall productivity.
* **Pay Equity:** Potential gender pay gaps exist, with males averaging $62,313.80 and females $58,068.50. Significant pay differences are also observed across racial groups, with the largest gap being $26,997.62 between the lowest and highest average salaries by race and gender.
* **Recruitment Effectiveness:** The company website (92.31%) and employee referrals (83.87%) yield the highest retention rates. Sources like CareerBuilder (52.17%) and Diversity Job Fairs (44.83%) show lower retention.
* **Employee Tenure:** IT/IS roles have shorter average tenures (1.48-3.85 years), while the Executive Office shows longer tenures (exceeding 6.10 years). Production shows similar tenure for management and entry-level roles, and Sales tenure varies by role.

## How to View the Analysis 👀
